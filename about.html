        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="wowlogo.png" />
        <p class="about-content">
          I have a deep and long running passion in gaming. From a young age I
          started with my father's NES and Super Mario Bros, developing a deep
          love in the hobby that lasted up to the present day.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
          My favorite games are World of Warcraft, the modern Doom series, Elder
          Scrolls series, Ultrakill, the Dishonored series, Marvel Rivals,
          Minecraft, and Heroes of the Storm. I tend to gravitate most of all to
          World of Warcraft where I often find myself raid leading for my guild
          as whatever class and role is needed for me to help us succeed.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
          Back in 2018 I also competed in Heroes of the Dorm collegiate league
          with the Robert Morris University in Chicago as their support player,
          though I had flexed into a few roles over my time there. We ended up
          placing nationally within the top 18.

        <h2>Comics</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="moonknight.jpg" />
        <p class="about-content">
          Comics have been a core passion and part of my life since I was
          little. From my passion for the Flash and Green Latern I gained from
          shows like Justice League and Justice League: Unlimited to learning
          about and reading comics from a camp counselor when I was little.
          Though these days I tend to lean more Marvel.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
          My favorite characters by far are Moon Knight and Khonshu, Spider-Man,
          Ultron, Captain America, and Ben Grimm The Thing. I highly recommend
          to anyone looking to get into Moon Knight to read the few runs by Jed
          Mckay that continue from Moon Knight into Vengeance of the Moon Knight
          and then Fist of Khonshu.

        <h2>Tabletop Roleplaying Games</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="d20.jpg" />
        <p class="about-content">
          A more recent passion of mine, I have often found myself roleplaying
          in various mediums through video games like World of Warcraft. Only
          recently have I properly delved into the proper tabletop experience
          after a very brief encounter back in high school through Pathfinder.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
          These days I play in one of my friend's D&D 5th edition game as the
          resident party's cleric where all of my spell slots are burned keeping
          the party from death's door. I have also found myself running a
          campaign using the Monster of the Week system based in a world of my
          design.
